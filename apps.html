        <p> We created a memory matching game that tests the user’s ability to remember a picture and recreate it. The first screen shows all of the three different levels, or ways to play the game. The user can click on any of the three buttons to take them to the level they want to play. There are short instructions next to each button that briefly describe what will happen in that level. In Level 1, there is an example cake on the left side of the screen. The user has to use the color buttons at the bottom of the screen to match the colors and patterns of the different cake layers. When they are finished with their design, the user can check their accuracy with the check button. The user can clear the screen if they make a mistake or return home to choose another level. Level 2 shows a different, more complicated example cake. The cake is displayed for 15 seconds before disappearing. The user cannot draw during the 15 seconds and must try and commit the design to memory. After 15 seconds, they can start to draw and recreate the cake, checking it with the check button once they are done. The third “level” is a free draw mode and allows the user to draw whatever designs they want or practice perfecting the first cakes. They can clear the screen to start over or return home to change levels.
