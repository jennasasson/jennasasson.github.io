        <h1> A Little About Me </h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Jenna Sasson and I am a Computer Science and Spanish double major <br>
            at the University of Rhode Island. I lived the past five years of my life in Dallas, TX <br>
            but now I live in northern New Jersey. <br> <br> <br>
            I enjoy playing all sports, especially soccer and watching Broadway musicals. I also like to read
            <br> and sing. </p>
